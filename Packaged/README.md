## Description

(CHEAT!) Prevents damage to ore voxels by miners and the player. Configurable chance to prevent the damage so you can customise just how much ore gets saved.

-- OLD --
Adds new technologies to the terraforming tech tree. These technologies dramatically boost the capabilities of the miners. They have a chance of summoning ore from the ether, protecting your valuable voxels. Each level of technology increases this chance by 25%, when all technologies are unlocked, ore voxels will never deplete!
